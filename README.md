# Todo app using Flask, Postgres, SQLAlchemy and Python

This is a not so simple todo application that implements CRUD functionality. You can create a list of Todo items, manage the list of items and delete them when you feel satisfied with the items on the list and no longer have a need for them.

## Usage

1. Go to line 8 of the `app.py` file and modify the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI app configuration to match the database connection settings you have set up in your machine.

2. On your terminal, `cd` to the project directory and run:

```bash
>>$ source .bash
```

And that should do it. Have fun with the app.
